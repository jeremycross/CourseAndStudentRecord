# CourseAndStudentRecord
A GUI application built with the aid of NetBeans which can be used to manage students (Designed to work on my machine since this was built years ago, improvements will be added if the time is found). 

*Improvements for future*
 - Add use of OOP design (students and courses can be made into objects)
 - Use serialization for remembering students
 - Single responsibility fulfilled
 - Recreate using JavaFX
  
The student record allows for editing, addition and removal of students within the system, the system is stored using textfiles to allow for non-volatile memory of the stored information  
List of navigation features on the student interface include:  
 - Listing all students/select students (based on their grade) with varying degree of provided information  
 - Navigate through individual students using next and previous buttons  
 - Search for a specific student based on student number or surname and jump to their location  
 - Utilizing a dropdown menu select a specific student
